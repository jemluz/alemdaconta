# Alem da conta

This project is an educational website that brings mathematics as a **way of thinking**, and not just as an isolated discipline.

a way to organize thought and understand the world.

## Overview

This project is an educational website built with Next.js, prioritizing simplicity, clarity, readability, and SEO. It uses shadcn/ui as the base for components for a minimalist and consistent interface.

## Project Vision

The site starts as a **content site**, simple, readable, and focused on reading and reflection.
Over time, as users engage and the content matures, the project can evolve to include:

- interactions between readers
- comments and discussions
- eventually, a study and reflection forum

This evolution is intentional and gradual.

## What this project is NOT (for now)

- It is not a complex application
- It does not have user authentication
- It does not have a database
- It does not have a comment or forum system
- It is not a dashboard or corporate platform

These decisions are intentional in this initial phase.

## Structure

- **Home**: Initial page with presentation of the concept and invitation to study.
- **Origin**: Explanation of the origin and philosophy of the project.
- **Syllabus**: Structure of educational contents.
- **Study**: Main learning area with layout prepared for sidebar.
- **Contact**: Contact information.

## Technologies

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Development

The project is structured to grow, with focus on static content initially. Navigation between pages is already functional, and the interface is consistent based on shadcn/ui.

Initially, only one complete level of the syllabus will be developed for validation of format, tone, and experience.
