## Central Principle of Evolution

Every new functionality must answer the question:

"Does this improve mathematical understanding and thinking, and/or encourage the student to exchange knowledge?"

If the answer is no, the functionality should not be implemented.

## The Forum as a Consequence, Not as a Starting Point

Interaction should arise from the content,
and not replace the content.

The forum, if it exists, should revolve around ideas,
questions, and interpretations — not quick answers.
