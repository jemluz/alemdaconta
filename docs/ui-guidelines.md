# Interface Guidelines (UI)

The project's interface should serve the content, never compete with it.

## UI Base

- All components should be based on shadcn/ui
- Custom styles should be minimal
- Clear typography is absolute priority

## Visual Principles

- Minimalism
- White space
- Comfortable reading rhythm
- Clear hierarchy of titles and texts

Avoid:

- dashboard visual
- excess of colors
- unnecessary animations
- elements that distract from reading

## Desired Experience

The site should seem like:

- a study space
- a calm place
- a reflection environment

It should not seem like:

- a corporate application
- a social network
- a productivity platform
