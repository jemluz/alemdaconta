# Conceptual Architecture of the Project

This project is structured in conceptual layers, not technical ones.

## Layer 1 — Content

Content is the core of the project.
It should be:

- technology-independent
- organized in levels, units, and texts
- easily reusable in the future

Content must survive framework changes.

## Layer 2 — Navigation Experience

Includes:

- Home as an invitation
- Study as the core
- Syllabus as a conceptual map
- Origin as philosophical alignment

Navigation should be clear, predictable, and focused on reading.

## Layer 3 — Interaction (future)

Interactions such as:

- comments
- discussions
- user profiles

They are not part of the initial phase, but should be possible in the future
without needing to rewrite the project.

## Growth Strategy

The project grows through:

1. Quality of content
2. Clarity of the proposal
3. Natural engagement

Not by quantity of features.
